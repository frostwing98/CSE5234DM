    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the \"Cleveland Data CLEANED AND TRIMMED.csv\" heart disease dataset provided on Carmen.  It is a subset of the \"Cleveland\" dataset that can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease\n",
    "\n",
    "You will configure, execute, and evaluate an off-the-shelf K-Nearest-Neighbor classifier and two other classifiers you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment are:\n",
    "1.\tUnderstand how to evaluate classifiers based on business criteria.\n",
    "2.\tUnderstand how to tune and evaluate a classifier to achieve good performance.\n",
    "3.\tUnderstand how to select and evaluate suitable off-the-shelf classifiers based on the characteristics of a dataset and the outcomes you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for a medical institution that wants to improve the heart health of its patients.  You have obtained a dataset that contains a variety of demographic and health-related information for a group of patients.  It also includes a CLASS variable \"num\" that indicates the heart health of each of the patients.  The values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. No heart health issues / risk\n",
    "1. Slight heart health issues / risk\n",
    "2. Moderate heart health issues / risk\n",
    "3. High heart health issues / risk\n",
    "4. Extreme heart health issue / risk\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked to develop a classifier based on the dataset data, to predict the CLASS of new patients so they can be enrolled in interventions based on their demographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The COSTs of the interventions are as follows, based on the predicted class of each patient\n",
    "\n",
    "0) Tiny intervention: 100 (dollars)\n",
    "1) Minor intervention: 200\n",
    "2) Moderate intervention: 300\n",
    "3) Significant intervention: 400\n",
    "4) Extreme intervention: 500\n",
    "\n",
    "The BENEFITs of the interventions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the classification is correct and the correct intervention given to the patient: 500 * (TRUE_CLASS + 1)\n",
    "- If an incorrect classification is made and the wrong intervention is given to the patient: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "You would like to find a classifier that maximizes the overall **NET_BENEFIT = BENEFIT - COST**. Therefore, a larger positive number is a good outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a patient's true class is 4 and their predicted class is 0, their NET_BENEFIT = 0 - 100 = -100\n",
    "- If a patient's true class is 4 and they are correctly classified, their NET_BENEFIT is 500*(4+1) - 500 = 2000\n",
    "\n",
    "The medical institution would like you to evaluate the use of a K-Nearest-Neighbor classifier as a starting point.  You agree to do so, as long as you then can choose a different classifier if you are not satisfied with KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration\n",
    "For this assignment, you should work as an individual. You may informally discuss ideas with classmates, but your work should be your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you need to turn in:\n",
    "1)\tCode\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tFor this homework, the code is the Jupyter Notebook.  Use the provided Jupyter Notebook template, and fill in the appropriate information.\n",
    "-\tYou may use common Python libraries for I/O, data manipulation, data visualization, etc. (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib,…  See reference below.) \n",
    "-\tYou may not use library operations that perform, in effect, the “core” computations for this homework (e.g., If the assignment is to write a K-Means algorithm, you may not use a library operation that, in effect, does the core work needed to implement a K-Means algorithm.).  When in doubt, ask the grader or instructor.\n",
    "-\tThe code must be written by you, and any significant code snips you found on the Internet and used to understand how to do your coding for the core functionality must be attributed.  (You do not need to attribute basic functionality – matrix operations, IO, etc.)\n",
    "-\tThe code must be commented sufficiently to allow a reader to understand the algorithm without reading the actual Python, step by step.\n",
    "-\tWhen in doubt, ask the grader or instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tWritten Report\n",
    "-\tFor this homework, the report is the Jupyter Notebook.  The report should be well-written.  Please proof-read and remove spelling and grammar errors and typos.\n",
    "-\tThe report should discuss your analysis and observations. Key points and findings must be written in a style suitable for consumption by non-experts.  Present charts and graphs to support your observations. If you performed any data processing, cleaning, etc., please discuss it within the report.\n",
    "\n",

    "> - Have you made an effort to tune it for good performance?\n",

    "6.\tEvaluation of the Third Classifier (20%)\n",
    "> - Is your algorithm design and coding correct?\n",
    "> - Is it well documented?\n",
    "> - Have you made an effort to tune it for good performance?\n",
    "> - Is the evaluation sound?\n",
    "7.\tComparison of the Three Classifiers (10%)\n",
    "> - Is the comparison sound?\n",
    "> - Did you choose a specific classifier as best and explain why?\n",
    "8.  Conclusions (5%)\n",
    "> - Did you summarize appropriately your critical findings. \n",
    "> - Did you provide appropriate conclusions and next steps.\n",
